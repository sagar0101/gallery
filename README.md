Title: Card-Based Gallery Project 


Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Card-Based Gallery project! In this project, I've created a stunning and interactive gallery using HTML and CSS. Through this project, I've not only developed an aesthetically pleasing web gallery but also learned and implemented various web development techniques. Here's a brief overview of what you can find in this repository:

1. **Hover Effects:** In this project, I've explored the use of "hover" effects to add interactivity to the gallery. You'll find cards that respond dynamically when you hover over them, creating a visually engaging user experience.

2. **Scaling Elements:** I've learned how to apply the "scale" transformation to elements on hover, allowing for smooth and elegant transitions when interacting with the gallery. This technique adds depth and vitality to the user interface.

3. **Parent and Child Tags:** The project demonstrates how to effectively structure HTML using parent and child tags. I've organized the gallery items within a parent container to achieve a cohesive layout and styling.

4. **Flexbox Layout:** One of the key aspects of this project is the use of Flexbox to align and center elements. You'll discover how I've leveraged Flexbox to position boxes and text precisely in the center of their containers, ensuring a balanced and harmonious design.

This GitHub repository is a valuable resource for web developers, designers, and anyone interested in learning about modern web development techniques. You can explore the code, experiment with it, and even use it as a foundation for your own projects. Feel free to fork this repository and contribute to its growth.

I hope you find this project inspiring and educational. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ
